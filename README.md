# Notes

To produce this board, the manufacture need to have these minimum capabilities:

* 0.1 mm minimum electrical clearance between traces pads and vias
* 0.09 mm minimum electrical clearance between BGA pads and traces
* Capability to cut the edge of the BGA pads if the minimum electrical clearance between BGA pads and traces are above 0.09 mm
* 0.09 mm minimum width of traces
* Via-in-pad according to IPC 4761 Type VII (Epoxy filled and clapped)
* Via hole size of 0.3 mm and via diameter of 0.4 mm
* Impedance control: JLC04161H-1080

I have been using JLCPCB as the manufacturer for this.
